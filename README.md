### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer.

I'm currently learning more about CyberSecurity by studing towards a Diploma.
I have achieved my Sec+ Certification from CompTIA (Security+) and am currently working on getting my CySA+ (CyberSecurity Analyst+).

You can also find my blog posts and other portfolio work at my website [Oxynerd.com](https://oxynerd.com)
